# GenIIoT: Generative Adversarial Networks Aided Proactive Fault Management in Industrial Internet of Things

## Description

This project implements an advanced machine learning system for proactive fault management in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments using AI-driven approaches. The system employs multiple machine learning architectures including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to analyze industrial sensor data and predict equipment failures.

The project addresses the critical need for automated predictive maintenance systems that can identify potential equipment failures in industrial environments, providing real-time monitoring capabilities for IIoT applications. By leveraging GAN-based synthetic data generation and traditional class-balancing techniques, the system effectively handles severe class imbalance challenges common in industrial fault prediction scenarios.
